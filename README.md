### Info

This is the open source repo of the web version of "PvZ2 Gardendless".

"PvZ2 Gardendless" is a rewritten "Plants vs Zombies 2" entirely using only Web technologies(including the cocos engine)!

### Warning: Please run the windows version with proton if you want GPU acceleration on linux/mac

Chromium webgl functionality highly experimental on linux/mac (especially when using the wayland backend). See [this issue](https://github.com/Gzh0821/pvzg_site/issues/85)

If you're using wine wayland driver, you might need to start the .exe with `--in-process-gpu` for it to work properly.
